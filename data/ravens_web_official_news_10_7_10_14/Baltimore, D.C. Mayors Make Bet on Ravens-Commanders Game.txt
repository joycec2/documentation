Baltimore Mayor Brandon Scott is stoked for the Ravens-Commanders game and proved it by challenging Washington Mayor Murial Bowser with a bet on social media.

"When the Ravens win, my bet to you is that you would have to declare my birthday, April 8. 2025, as Baltimore Club Music Day in D.C. and provide me with whatever kind of crabcakes you guys actually have in D.C.," Scott said.

Bowser accepted the challenge, and then some.

"I'll see your challenge and raise you," Bowser wrote. "When the Commanders win, you'll declare DC Go-Go Day, we get your crab cakes, and you post on social media encouraging people to visit the National Zoo to welcome our iconic giant pandas. If the Ravens squeak out a victory, we'll give you a half-smoke, we'll proclaim Baltimore Club Music Day, and we'll post to encourage people to visit the Baltimore National Aquarium. And thanks for inviting me to the game."
