Last Monday, the Ravens hosted their annual Caw to Action community service event where they partnered with United Way of Central Maryland. A few days later, they were honored by the United Way Tocqueville Society with the Organization of the Year award for their work within the local community.

"The Ravens are committed to addressing the many issues facing communities in their hometown," United Way said in a statement. "By engaging and supporting the region through their own charitable programs and initiatives, the Ravens consistently go the distance for their fans and neighbors in Baltimore.

"Since 2019, they have partnered with United Way of Central Maryland for the annual Caw to Action community service events. Now in its sixth year, Caw to Action activates more than thirty thousand volunteers across 130 sites of serviceâ€”a true testament to the Baltimore Ravens' dedication to the community that cheers them on."

This year's Caw to Action saw the community commit more than 6 million minutes of volunteer time with events ranging from work at animal shelters to helping in soup kitchens.

Players, coaches, staff, and members of the community all volunteered time to strengthen the local area, and it couldn't have been done without the partnership with United Way.

"We are grateful to the United Way of Central Maryland for this recognition and even more appreciative of the ongoing partnership we've shared with them over the past several years," Vice President of Community Relations Heather Darney said. "Together, we've been able to make a difference in so many communities across our state, and we look forward to continuing and expanding upon the impact of our collaborative efforts."
