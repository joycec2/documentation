The Ravens have now won four in a row, topping the Washington Commanders, 30-23, at M&T Bank Stadium Sunday.

Zay Flowers' historic first half helped Baltimore's offense get going, and Derrick Henry played closer with a pair of touchdowns and another 100-yard rushing day to secure the win over Washington (4-2).

Here's how it happened:

Turning Point
Leading by a touchdown in the third quarter, the Ravens had their biggest drive of the game, going 94 yards to take the game's first two-possession lead. The drive was highlighted by a 38-yard catch by Mark Andrews, setting up a 7-yard touchdown run from Henry.

The Commanders scored on their ensuing possession, but a clutch drive from Baltimore ended with a Justin Tucker field goal and gave the Ravens another double-digit lead. Washington made it a one-possession game late, but Henry's 27-yard run virtually iced the game.

Top Play
On third-and-8 at the end of the second quarter, Jackson found Andrews in the back of the end zone for a 13-yard score. It gave the Ravens a 17-10 halftime lead and was Andrews' 41st career touchdown, tying him with tight end Todd Heap for the most scores in franchise history. It was Andrews' first touchdown of the season.

Stock Watch
WR Zay Flowers

Flowers set a new career-high for receiving yards, and he needed just one half to get there. All 132 of Flowers' yards came before halftime as he had catches of 44, 23, 15, and 13 yards. Much like the joint practice last year, no one on the Commanders could guard him.

DT Travis Jones

Following a turnover from the Ravens, Jones came up with a clutch sack on third down to force a Washington field goal. It was Jones' first sack of the season as he's been a force inside but hadn't closed yet. Jones also added two tackles for loss.

RB Derrick Henry

Henry's second quarter run made him just the second player in NFL history to score a touchdown in each of his first six games with a franchise. Henry had two scores Sunday, running for 132 yards on 24 carries. At 30 years old, he's proving that age is just a number.

TE Mark Andrews

In addition to his historic touchdown, Andrews added a catch of 38 yards and another of 15. After a slow start to the season which included two consecutive games without a catch, Andrews had his best game of the season Sunday with 66 yards and a score.
