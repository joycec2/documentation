It's a beautiful day and the Ravens got good news Thursday with the return of three starters to practice as they prepare to take on the Washington Commanders.

Cornerback Marlon Humphrey (ankle), left tackle Ronnie Stanley (toe), and wide receiver Rashod Bateman (groin) all returned to practice on a limited basis.

The only Ravens missing were defensive lineman Broderick Washington (knee), linebacker Malik Harrison (groin), and offensive lineman Sala Aumavae-Laulu (back).

Cornerback Arthur Maulet, who tweaked his hamstring last week after being activated from the injured reserve list, is also not back on the practice field yet.
