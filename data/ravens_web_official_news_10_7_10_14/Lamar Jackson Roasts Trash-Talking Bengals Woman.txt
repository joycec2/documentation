Lamar Jackson and some teammates were enjoying their dinner Saturday night in Cincinnati when they got unexpected visitors.

The restaurant owner kept letting people into the private room with Jackson, Eddie Jackson, and Zay Flowers. One Louisville (and Bengals) fan was respectful, but another Bengals fan went viral for her trash-talk towards the two-time MVP.

The next day, Jackson torched her Bengals for over 400 total yards and four touchdowns as the Ravens won a 41-38 classic in overtime. And Jackson didn't forget about what happened.

"I don't know this lady. She came in, 'We're going to kick your [butt].' I'm like, I got mad. She's going to be the reason we're going to end up winning," Jackson said.

"I wonder how she felt after that. She probably seen it, one of her grandsons or something probably showed it to her. Just be a fan next time. Just let us play. Let the guys do the talking."
