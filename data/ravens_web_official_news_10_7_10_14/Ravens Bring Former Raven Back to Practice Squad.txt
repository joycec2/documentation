Damarion "Pepe" Williams, a Ravens fourth-round pick in 2022, has been signed to the practice squad.

The 26-year-old defensive back spent two seasons with Baltimore before he was released in August during final roster cuts. Williams can play outside, in the slot, or safety and is familiar with Baltimore's defensive scheme.

Williams appeared in 14 games as a rookie playing defense (226 snaps) and special teams (134 snaps). However, he spent most of the 2023 season on injured reserve following ankle surgery and was limited to just one game.

The Ravens had an opening after the Houston Texans signed cornerback Kaâ€™dar Hollman off Baltimore's practice squad.

Hollman appeared in three games with Baltimore this season and was out of practice squad elevations. He played 17 games with the Texans in 2023, primarily on special team.
