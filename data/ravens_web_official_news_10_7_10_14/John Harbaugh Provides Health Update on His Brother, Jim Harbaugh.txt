Family and football is a common refrain, and family comes first.

So when Jim Harbaugh, John's brother, experienced a health issue during Sunday's Chargers-Broncos game, the Ravens and General Manager Eric DeCosta interrupted John's postgame press conference to give him the update.

Jim turned out to be fine. After going in the blue medical tent on the sideline, he briefly went back to the locker room for further evaluation during the first quarter.

Jim later explained that he has atrial flutter, a type of heart arrythmia, that flared up during the game. He also said he had a similar episode during a 2012 game with the 49ers, and his team won that game too.

"I talked to Jim this morning. He's doing well, doing great. Feeling a lot better," John said.

"[He] said he was feeling a little off that day and the day before just a little bit. He's had that issue in the past, had a couple procedures over the years for that very issue. Even as a player, he had it one time. But he's doing good now and he's going to get some tests done today."

John got on the phone with former Raven turned Chargers General Manager Joe Hortiz as soon as possible Sunday evening after being pulled from the press conference.

"We knew [he] wasn't immediately in trouble at that point," John said. "Later, it calmed down enough where, I don't think the doctors really wanted him necessarily to go out there, but they cleared him somehow â€¦ somehow he convinced them to clear him to go out there and get back on the field and he was fine."

John said he doesn't have the same heart condition as his brother. He thanked the many people who reached out to him offering their concern and prayers.
