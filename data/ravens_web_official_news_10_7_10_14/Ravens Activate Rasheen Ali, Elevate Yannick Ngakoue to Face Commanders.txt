Rookie running back Rasheen Ali has been activated from injured reserve to face the Washington Commanders in Week 6, while veteran defensive end Yannick Ngakoue has been elevated from the practice squad for the second straight game.

Ali returned to practice Oct. 3 and Head Coach John Harbaugh said Friday that the fifth-round pick has made steady progress after suffering a neck injury during the preseason. Ali rushed for 1,135 yards and 15 touchdowns last season at Marshall. He will be available to contribute on special teams and as the No. 3 back behind Derrick Henry and Justice Hill.

Running back Chris Collier, who played 11 snaps on special teams Week 5 against the Cincinnati Bengals, has reached the maximum three practice squad elevations for game days. Collier would need to sign to the 53-man roster in order to play for the Ravens again this season.

Ngakoue played 11 snaps with one quarterback hit while making his season debut against the Bengals. A former star at the University of Maryland, the 29-year-old Ngakoue played with the Ravens in 2020 and was signed Sept. 24 to add more depth to the pass rush.
