The Ravens didn't have three key starters on the field Wednesday, as cornerback Marlon Humphrey (ankle), left tackle Ronnie Stanley (toe), and wide receiver Rashod Bateman (groin) did not practice.

Humphrey was seen in a walking boot following Sunday's win in Cincinnati. On Monday, Head Coach John Harbaugh said he didn't think there were any serious injuries in the game.

"These are physical, tough games, [and] you're on the turf and all that," Harbaugh said when specifically asked about Humphrey. "I just don't want to make any promises, but I think we're in good shape."â€¯

Bateman was on the field for the Ravens' second-to-last offensive play of the game (not the 51-yard Derrick Henry run in overtime). Stanley also finished the game.

Defensive lineman Broderick Washington (knee) and linebacker Malik Harrison (groin) also did not practice.

"All the things I would categorize as being just normal after game type of things that you deal with at this point in the season," Harbaugh said Wednesday.

Arthur Maulet, who tweaked his hamstring after being activated from injured reserve with a knee injury, is still not back at practice. He's been out since last Thursday. Maulet is in the second week of his 21-day practice window.

Fifth round rookie Rasheen Ali (neck), who is on injured reserve, was a full participant Wednesday. Ali's 21-day practice window was opened last week.

Wide receiver/returner Deonte Harty (knee) didn't play last week and was limited on Wednesday, while guard Andrew Vorhees (ankle) was a full participant after missing the last two games. Tackle Roger Rosengarten (ankle/hand) and tight end Charlie Kolar (toe) were both limited Wednesday.
